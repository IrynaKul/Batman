Kommentar: In order to be able to run our application one must enable CORS (Cross-origin-resource-sharing) since the API we use doesnÂ´t allow cross-origin-resource-sharing). You can download a CORS extension for chrome in which one can enable CORS. The extension can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
